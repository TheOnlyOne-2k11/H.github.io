# Crack phone simulation 
hello! Today, I wrote a Python code file â€“ it's a crack phone simulation. It simulates unlocking a phone's home screen. It's quite powerful because if you had the real code, you could actually unlock the phone ðŸ˜…. At that point, with the real code and a USB OTG to connect two devices, you could run that dangerous script, and the phone would be unlocked instantly. But this relates to ethics, and you could get arrested by the police, so I only wrote a Python script to simulate the unlocking process for people to try it out.
#how to use:
"First, you need to install the colorama library."

Install colorama:
``` Bash
pip install colorama
```

End, you download file and run. You can run in termux, pydroid 3 or Python in you computer.
